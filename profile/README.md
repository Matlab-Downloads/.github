## What is MATLAB?

**MATLAB** is a high-performance programming language and interactive environment developed by MathWorks, designed specifically for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use platform where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. MATLAB is used across a vast range of applications including **signal processing and communications**, **image and video processing**, **control systems**, **test and measurement**, **computational finance**, and **computational biology**.

Unlike traditional programming languages, MATLAB enables users to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications with a powerful array of built-in mathematical functions. The language, apps, and toolboxes allow you to explore multiple approaches and arrive at a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages. Its desktop environment invites experimentation, exploration, and discovery with live scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook. For engineers and scientists worldwide, MATLAB is the foundational tool for research, development, and innovation.
